# Clothing Club-TOP
This exercise or project on completion has helped me put to practice all I have learnt in The Odin Project Foundation Lessons. There is an extensive use of `flex` which is the aim of this project. Upon completion I have been able to recreate a layout of a web page as given in the project.

## Appreciation
All thanks goes to 
- **TOP(The Odin Project)**

## Credits:
Unfortunately credits goes to me alone as no images was used as I thought at the beginning of the project
_Well... this is a a project to recreate an already given webpage layout so credit goes to TOP_
